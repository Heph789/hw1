Notes:
- I wrote test functions for push_back, pop_back, push_front, pop_front, but not getValLocation nor back/front because I felt the former was tested sufficiently in the other test functions and the latter were sufficiently simple (and also used in the other test functions)
- No other special instructions. Code is run and compiled with g++ command given in instructions.
